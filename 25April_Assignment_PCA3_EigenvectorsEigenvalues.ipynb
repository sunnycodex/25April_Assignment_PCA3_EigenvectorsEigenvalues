    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are concepts in linear algebra that describe how a linear transformation affects a nonzero vector. An eigenvector is a vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when the transformation is applied to it. An eigenvalue is the scalar factor by which the eigenvector is scaled. The eigenvector points in the direction of the transformation, and the eigenvalue indicates the magnitude and sign of the transformation.\n",

    "Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?\n",
    "--\n",
    "---\n",
    "In linear algebra, eigen decomposition, also known as spectral decomposition, is a factorization technique for breaking down a square matrix into its constituent eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It involves finding a set of eigenvectors that form a basis for the matrix's eigenspace and the corresponding eigenvalues that represent the scaling factors along these directions.\n",

    "**Significance of Eigen Decomposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen decomposition holds immense significance in linear algebra due to its versatility and ability to reveal fundamental properties of square matrices. Here are some key reasons why eigen decomposition is considered a crucial tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Matrix Properties:** Eigen decomposition provides valuable insights into the behavior of square matrices. Eigenvalues represent the magnitudes of variance along the directions of the corresponding eigenvectors, indicating how much the matrix stretches or shrinks vectors along these directions. This information helps in understanding the matrix's behavior in transforming vectors and its overall impact on the data it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Solving Systems of Linear Equations:** Eigen decomposition can be employed to solve homogeneous systems of linear equations. By expressing the system in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, the solution can be determined efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diagonalization of Matrices:** Eigen decomposition enables the diagonalization of square matrices. A matrix is said to be diagonalizable if it can be transformed into a diagonal matrix, where the diagonal entries represent the eigenvalues and the off-diagonal entries are zero. Diagonalization simplifies the analysis of the matrix and its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applications in Machine Learning:** Eigen decomposition plays a vital role in various machine learning algorithms, particularly in dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA). PCA utilizes eigen decomposition to identify the principal components, which represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. By projecting the data onto these components, we can reduce the dimensionality while preserving the most important information."

As a result, the matrix cannot be fully diagonalized, and the off-diagonal entries will remain even after applying the eigen-decomposition approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unequal algebraic and geometric multiplicities:** If the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue exceeds its geometric multiplicity, it indicates that there are not enough eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue to form a basis for its eigenspace.

    "The spectral theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that provides conditions under which a matrix can be diagonalized. It states that for any symmetric matrix, there are exactly n (possibly not distinct) eigenvalues, and they are all real. Further, the associated eigenvectors can be chosen so as to form an orthonormal basis. This is significant because it guarantees the existence of a basis of eigenvectors for these types of matrices, which is a crucial requirement for a matrix to be diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral theorem is directly related to the diagonalizability of a matrix. If a matrix is symmetric, then it is orthogonally diagonalizable. This means there exists an orthogonal matrix P such that A = PDP^T, where D is a diagonal matrix. The columns of P are the eigenvectors of A, and the entries of D are the corresponding eigenvalues.\n",
